## ProtonMail Header Display

### Description

A [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/) plugin to improve integration with [ProtonMail Bridge](https://protonmail.com/bridge/).
ProtonMail adds `X-PM-*` headers to your mail to indicate whether it was end-to-end (E2E) encrypted and whether it came from another ProtonMail address, but these aren't easily-visible in Thunderbird. This plugin shows you the encryption status of each email as you view it. There are four statuses:

![E2E encrypted internal mail from other ProtonMail users, PGP-encrypted email from non ProtonMail users, encrypted mail stored encrypted by ProtonMail, and completely unencrypted mail such as stored locally in your Sent or Drafts folder](https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/x-pm-display.png)
